"""Calibration capture: a hook the dispatch machinery runs before a forward.

The calibration modes (GPTQ, AWQ) observe the inputs of every layer they
quantize while calibration data flows through a block. Rather than
replacing a layer's `call` for the duration, a capture is registered on
the layer and `Operation._dispatch_call`, the one place that selects the
forward pass, runs it before the forward it dispatches to: `call` or
`quantized_call`, eager or rematerialized, under `__call__` or
`stateless_call`. Nothing on the layer is rebound, so there is nothing to
restore and a dispatch change cannot orphan calibration silently.
